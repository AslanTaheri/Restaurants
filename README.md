# Restaurants V1.0.0

**This is a work in progress.** A full stack prototype for writing a review for my favorite restaurants. 
I made this project as an opportunity to practice setting up a full stack PERN application, 
building a REST API, and connecting it to the front-end interface using React for seamless CRUD operations. As my build tool I used Vite, which gives me a faster and lighter set up compared to the create-react-app.

I am currently learning Typescript and as the next step, I would like to re-construct this project in a type-safe fashion
both on the backend and frontend using Typescript.

Technologies used:
PostgreSQL, PG, Express, Node, React, Bootstrap, Vite
